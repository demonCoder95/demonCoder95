### Hi! I'm Noor :)

I'm a DevOps Engineer with expertise in Virtual and Containerized infrastructure design, deployment, scaling and security.
I'm an Open Source contributor with contributions in Airship, Metal3-io, Operator Framework, Openstack Ironic and others.
I write small utility programs, often just for fun!

I work with ``Python``, ``C`` and ``C++`` mostly with Ubuntu as platform of choice for development.
